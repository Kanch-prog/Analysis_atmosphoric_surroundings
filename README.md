What-If Analysis of Atmospheric Soundings Data

Sourced from the Upper Air Sounding website maintained by the University of Wyoming Upper Air Sounding, 
to explore the impact of hypothetical changes in atmospheric conditions on key variables such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. The data pertains to measurements taken in January 2011 from Hyderabad Airport (Station Number: 43128) in Southeast Asia.

  1.Data Processing.
  2.Apply hypothetical changes to key atmospheric variables.
  3.Increase temperature by 5Â°C at all altitudes.
  4.Decrease pressure by 10 millibars at all altitudes.
  5.Increase relative humidity by 2% at all altitudes, ensuring it does not exceed 100%.
  6.Plot the relationships between temperature, pressure, and humidity before and after applying the changes.
  7.Analyze the effects of the changes on atmospheric conditions.

The "What-If" analysis helps in understanding the potential impact of hypothetical changes in atmospheric conditions on temperature, pressure, and humidity. This can be useful for various applications such as weather forecasting, flight planning, and environmental research.
